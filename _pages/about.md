I am a PhD candidate in the [Astronomy Centre](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/astronomy/) of the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/) where I am working in the field of observational cosmology.

Before moving to the UK I obtained my Bachelor's (2014) and Master's (2017) degree in physics at the [LMU Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). You can check out my complete CV [here](../files/Porth_CV.pdf) and my publication list [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0003-1176-6346&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).
